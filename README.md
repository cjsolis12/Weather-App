# Weather-App


## Description
This is a weather app using the api https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key} to get the current weather. User can search a city and should be displayed the current weather as well as the consecutive 5 days. I was able to practice my skills calling an api using the fetch function.
